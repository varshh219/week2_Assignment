# Week 2 – Making Decisions & Loops in Python  
## Data Science Internship Assignment  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This assignment was completed as part of my Data Science Internship program.  
The primary objective of Week 2 was to understand decision-making and repetition in Python by developing a Student Grade Calculator application.

The program collects a student’s name and marks, validates the input, calculates the grade using conditional statements, and displays an encouraging message based on performance.

This task strengthened my understanding of control flow, looping, modular programming, and basic error handling concepts essential for data science development.

## Objectives  

- Understand and implement if-elif-else statements  
- Learn comparison operators (> , < , >= , <= , ==)  
- Use while loops for repeated validation  
- Create reusable functions  
- Handle errors using try-except  
- Develop a structured console-based Python application  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- Python 3.x  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

## Execution  

### Step 1: Install Python  

Download Python from:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Verify installation:

python --version

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Folder  

cd week2

### Step 3: Run the Program  

python grade_calculator.py

## Technical Details  

### Concepts Implemented  

- Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)  
- Comparison Operators  
- While Loop  
- Functions  
- Input Validation  
- Error Handling (try-except)  
- Console Output Formatting  

---

### Algorithm  

1. Prompt the user to enter student name  
2. Use a while loop to collect marks  
3. Validate marks (must be numeric and between 0–100)  
4. Apply grading logic using if-elif-else  
5. Assign grade based on marks range  
6. Display grade along with an encouraging message  

---

### Program Flow  

Input → Validation → Processing → Output  

---

## Testing Evidence  

The application was tested using multiple inputs to ensure:

- Correct grade calculation  
- Proper range validation (0–100)  
- Handling of negative values  
- Handling of non-numeric inputs  
- No runtime errors  

Example Test Case:

Input:  
Name: Priya  
Marks: 85  

Output:  
Grade: B  
Message: Very Good! Keep it up!

## Learning Outcomes  

By completing this assignment, I gained:

- Practical experience with decision-making in Python  
- Understanding of loops and validation techniques  
- Knowledge of writing reusable functions  
- Confidence in handling runtime errors  
- Improved logical thinking and code organization
