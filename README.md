# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator
## Week 2 – Data Science Internship Assignment

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship program (Week 2).

The objective of this assignment was to understand decision-making and repetition in Python by building a console-based Student Grade Calculator.

The program:
- Accepts student name and marks
- Validates marks input (0–100 only)
- Calculates grade using conditional statements
- Displays an encouraging message
- Handles invalid and non-numeric inputs gracefully

This project strengthens foundational programming concepts required for data science and software development.

## Objectives

- Implement if-elif-else statements
- Use comparison operators
- Apply while loops for validation
- Create reusable functions
- Handle errors using try-except
- Build a structured Python program

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python

Download Python from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Verify installation:

python --version

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Folder

cd week2

---

### Step 3: Run the Program

python grade_calculator.py

---

## Technical Details

### Concepts Implemented

- Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
- Comparison Operators
- While Loop
- Functions
- Input Validation
- Error Handling (try-except)
- Console Output Formatting

## Grading Logic

A : 90 – 100  
B : 80 – 89  
C : 70 – 79  
D : 60 – 69  
F : 0 – 59  

Each grade includes a motivational message.

---

## Algorithm

1. Display program title
2. Ask user to enter student name
3. Use a while loop to collect valid marks
4. Check if input is numeric using try-except
5. Validate marks range (0–100)
6. Apply grading logic using if-elif-else
7. Display grade and encouraging message
8. End program

---

## Testing Evidence

The program was tested with:

Valid Inputs:
- 95 → Grade A
- 85 → Grade B
- 72 → Grade C
- 65 → Grade D
- 40 → Grade F

Invalid Inputs:
- 120 → Range validation error
- -5 → Range validation error
- abc → Numeric input error

All scenarios were successfully handled.

## Program Flow

Input → Validation → Processing → Output

- Input Layer: Collects name and marks
- Validation Layer: Ensures valid numeric range
- Logic Layer: Determines grade
- Output Layer: Displays formatted result

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained:

- Strong understanding of decision-making in Python
- Experience with loops and validation
- Confidence in handling runtime errors
- Improved logical thinking
- Better code organization practices
